# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website built with React. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a frontend and backend developer. It’s designed to be a dynamic, easy-to-navigate site for potential employers or clients to get to know me better.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A brief introduction and summary of who I am.
- **About Me**: Details about my background, education, and skills.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my past and current projects with links to the repositories and repo link.
- **Contact**: A contact form where visitors can send messages directly to me.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Installation

To set up the portfolio website locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Once you’ve cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

Now, you can start the development server to view the website locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Open that link in your browser to see the portfolio in action.

## Customization

To personalize the portfolio, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Content**: Go to the `src/pages` folder and modify the content for each page (About, Projects, etc.) to reflect your own details.
2. **Change the Theme**: Update the styles in `src/styles` or modify the components in `src/components` to adjust the design to your liking.
3. **Add Projects**: In the `Projects` section, you can add or remove project entries by editing the `src/data/projects.js` file.

You can copy and paste this into your `README.md` file for your portfolio project. Don’t forget to replace the placeholder text with your actual details (e.g., GitHub username, LinkedIn profile, etc.).
